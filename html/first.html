	<h1>MOMOTARO, OR THE STORY OF THE SON OF A PEACH</h1>
    <h2>chapter 1 " Birth and Growth"</h2>
    <h3>老夫婦が川で拾った桃から子供が生まれて、桃太郎と名付けられ大きく育った。</h3>
    <p>
Long, long ago there lived, an old man and an old woman; they were peasants, and had to work hard to earn their daily rice. The old man used to go and cut grass for the farmers around, and while he was gone the old woman, his wife, did the work of the house and worked in their own little rice field.
One day the old man went to the hills as usual to cut grass and the old woman took some clothes to the river to wash.
It was nearly summer, and the country was very beautiful to see in its fresh greenness as the two old people went on their way to work. The grass on the banks of the river looked like emerald velvet, and the pussy willows along the edge of the water were shaking out their soft tassels.
